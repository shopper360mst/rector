Just clone the folder and you may need 

>***composer install***

to install its dependencies. Don't have to host this project as this is just a php tool.

Then place your src folder in this case, is our ***src/Entity*** 
place the folder inside the 

***rector\vendor\bin***

e.g. rector\vendor\bin\src\ 
place all your entity classes inside sub-folder or here. 
then fire the command 

> rector process src
